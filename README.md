# OS & Systems Revision Sheet

---

## Kernel
- Definition
- Purpose
- Responsibilities (Memory, Scheduling, Security, I/O)
- Kernel vs OS
- Kernel designs:
  - Monolithic
  - Layered
  - Microkernel
  - Modular

---

## Processes & Threads
- Process states
- Zombie process
- Suspended process
- Context switching
- Thread vs process
- Race condition

---

## Synchronization & Deadlocks
- Mutual exclusion
- Conditions for deadlock
- Starvation vs deadlock

---

## Interrupts & Multiprogramming
- OS is interrupt-driven
- Multiprogramming vs Multitasking
- Time slicing

---

## Virtualization & VMM
- Type 1 vs Type 2 hypervisors
- vCPU
- vCPU context switch (save/load state)
- Pinned vs shared vCPUs
- Trap-and-emulate
- Ring -1 privilege
- Virtual servers and flexibility
- VM isolation and risks
- VM escape and hypervisor vulnerabilities

---

## Emulation
- Guest ISA â‰  Host ISA
- Instruction translation
- Interpreter vs Dynamic Binary Translation vs AOT
- JIT basics
- Shader compilation stutter analogy

---

## Virtualization vs Emulation
- Hardware homogeneity
- Performance
- Portability
- Virtualization = native execution
- Emulation = translation required

---

## CPU Architectures
- x86-64 (x64)
- ARM64 (AArch64)
- CISC vs RISC
- Registers count
- Instruction encoding
- Ecosystem (PCs vs mobile/servers)

---

## C Programming Basics
- `static` keyword
- `volatile` keyword
- `malloc` and heap vs stack
- `register` keyword
- `static` vs Java `static`
- Memory layout of a process
- Macros
- Memory-mapped devices
